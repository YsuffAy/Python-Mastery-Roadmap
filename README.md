## About This Project

This repository is more than just a collection of code; it is a living document of my journey to master Python from the ground up, applying a first-principles approach. The goal is to solidify my own knowledge by teaching each concept and to create a structured, high-quality resource for anyone on a similar path.


## Project Structure

Every module in this roadmap is organized into a dedicated directory and contains three core files:

* **`README.md`**: Contains the theoretical explanation of the concepts, written in an instructional format.
* **`examples.py`**: Provides clean, commented code examples to demonstrate the practical application of the concepts.
* **`exercises.py`**: Includes solved problems and challenges to test and reinforce the understanding of the topic.

## The Roadmap / Table of Contents

Here is the structured path this project follows. Each item links to its respective module.

* [**01 - Foundations**](./01_Foundations/)
* [**02 - Operators**](./02_Operators/)
* [**03 - Data Structures**](./03_Data_Structures/) *(In Progress)*
* [**04 - Control Flow**](./04_Control_Flow/) *(Up Next)*
* (...this list will be updated as the project progresses)*

## Current Status

* **✅ Completed:** Module 01, Module 02
* **⏳ In Progress:** Module 03 - Data Structures
* **➡️ Up Next:** Module 04 - Control Flow
